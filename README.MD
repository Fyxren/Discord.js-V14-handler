The slash/application command handler which I use. It's a modified version from [this handler](https://github.com/Nathaniel-VFX/Discord.js-v14-Command-Handlers), which is made by [Nathaniel-VFX](https://github.com/Nathaniel-VFX). He (or she/something else, idk tbh) did an amazing job.

I did change some stuff like add config files for colors, emojis and default embeds and overal changed it a bit to my needs & way of doing things. I decided to put it on GitHub to make it easy for me to clone the handler for my projects (_which I won't ever finish_). Feel free to use it

I'm planning on adding more branches for e.g MySQL & multiple languages.

## Features
- Commands handler
- Events handler
- Permissions handler (_botPerms: []_ & _userPerms: []_)
- Cooldowns (_Using [Discord.js' Collection](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/collection/main/class/Collection)_)
- Config files
    - Colors (_main, done, fail, error, pending_) | E.g. `client.c.main`
    - Emotes (_done, fail, error, pending_) | E.g. `client.e.done`
    - Prebuilt embeds
        ```js
        /*
            With args: fail(desc) - done(desc) - cooldown(duration)
            You likely never need to use 'cooldown()', but you can change the text
        */
        interaction.reply(client.embeds.done('Target assasinated'));

        // Without args: loading(), error()
        interaction.reply(client.embeds.error());
        ```

## Setting up
- You can use this template by clicking the "Use this template" button. Run `yarn install`, `npm install` or whatever package manager you use. 
- Change the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the bot [token] and bot ID. 
> Guild ID is only needed if you're planning on using the bot in 1 server or for testing purposes. Planning on using it in multiple guilds? Just leave it empty and it should work.
